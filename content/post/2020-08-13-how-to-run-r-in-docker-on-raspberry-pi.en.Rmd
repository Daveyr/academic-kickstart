When I began learning about how to use Docker I stumbled on an excellent project called [Rocker](https://www.rocker-project.org/). For anyone with an x86 machine these Rocker images allow them to run R and most of its dependencies in a containerised environment. Plumber APIs, anyone? What about your own Shiny server? Finally, data scientists using R can have the same level of control on dependencies and package versions as Python users have become accustomed to through `venv`.

Things are a little more complicated for ARM users, especially 32-bit ARM architectures such as the Raspberry Pi. No Rocker images offer such compatibility so we're on our own. This was the major reason I've started a project, called, [ARMR](https://www.algorist.co.uk/project/armr/), to build a series of Docker images that **do** offer compatibility with the lovable credit card sized computer.

# Hello world

Whilst not much has happened with the project so far, at least I have a version of "Hello world": a container with r-base installed. But first we must install Docker.

## Installation

## Build a container

Building a container is as simple as writing the code below to a file called `Dockerfile`. We use an arm32 ubuntu image as a base, from which we set an environment variable to force the terminal to be non-interactive. This is because when r-base is installed it waits for user input when setting parameters, hanging the container build. By setting the installation to be non-interactive we accept all the defaults, including timezone. Be mindful of this when handling datetimes!

```
FROM arm32v7/ubuntu
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt update && apt install r-base -y
```

Once the Dockerfile is created you run it by typing `docker build` in the same folder in the terminal.

# What's next?
Future development is likely to encompass the following:

* Shiny server (I'd like to host one on this site)
* Plumber API server
* Rstudio server (so I can do analysis from anywhere on anything, even a tablet)
* Images for commonly used packages (Tidyverse, data.table, caret, etc.)
