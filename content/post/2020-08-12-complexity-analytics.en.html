<p>Utilities companies such as water, electricity and gas networks operate in complex environments. In my time with Arcadis Gen I’ve seen diverse reactions from clients in the face of such complexity:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t have enough data/it’s not clean enough to use</li>
<li>I’m drinking from a fire hydrant! It’s not possible to keep pace with my newly acquired data</li>
<li>It’s too difficult to make data driven decisions as I don’t have the expertise</li>
</ul>
<p>I will refer to this as the three stages of data grief. In the face of complexity, companies often demand a high level of model precision. However, most companies generally can’t match this with the quantity and quality of data it requires. This explains the common reaction of, “I don’t have enough data”. When authorisation is given to collect more data, the next reaction happens: “I can’t keep pace with my data”. Finally, when an organisation devotes time to organising its warehouse of data then the final reaction occurs: “it’s too difficult to make sense of my data”.</p>
<p>I have a hunch that some of the issues experienced are because many people conflate complexity with being complicated. Complexity needn’t be complicated; they are not the same thing. Complex is a description of the system in which a company operates. It is something that you generally cannot control. Complicated is a description of the analytical <em>approach</em> that a company might take. How complicated your analysis might be is very much something that you can control.</p>
<p>But surely you need a complicated model to accurately model a complex system? It turns out that this is frequently not true. Ironically, understanding a complex system can become easier when interpreting a simple model. At Arcadis Gen we’re very aware of the trade-offs that have to be made when modelling. At one extreme it is possible to build a complicated and precise model, but one that makes inaccuracte predictions because it does not generalise in the real world. At the other extreme is a simple model that is easily understood and can make accurate predictions, but lacks the precision to be useful. The first model might predict your asset effective age to be 1000.1338273 years old (precisely wrong); the second might predict it to be between 0 and 80 years (accurate but imprecise). The sweet spot lies somewhere inbetween, where a model is understandable and auditable yet yields actionable insights into the dominant causal relationships at work.</p>

<p>Lets look at a concrete example to illustrate. We’re using an open dataset relating to the construction of nuclear power plants in the USA in the late 1960’s and 1970’s. We would like to predict the cost of future power plants.</p>
