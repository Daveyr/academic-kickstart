## Via negativa
The "do something" fallacy is the mistaken belief that in the face of a problem the act of doing something/anything is always superior to doing nothing. It is closely related to the agency problem, where the agent (e.g., a doctor) must often be seen to be doing something in order to justify their position as an agent, even if premeditated inaction is in the best interest of the priniciple (e.g., the patient). 

One of the most prominent illustrations of this in my work is in asset management, where the no-investment case is always the most risky, and any intervention (whether refurbishment or replacement) will reduce the risk. In general this is true, but there are nuances to the approach. What about infant mortality of assets where damage has occurred during installation or where there are manufacturing defects? How is this superior to not replacing an asset that has exceeded its expected life but is otherwise operating just fine? What about finger tip maintenance or stress tests that due to operator error actually cause failure? The observer effect is a phenomenon not readily acknowledged in asset maintenance. It is worth remembering that the Chernobyl nuclear power station meltdown of 1986 was caused during a drill to test the preparedness for the reactor being operated outside of its limits.

## Burden of proof of the novel.
Tobacco, thalydomide.

## The curse of size
Planning fallacy and how banks became "too big to fail". Small projects have small errors that come out in the wash.

## Top down versus bottom up
Rationalism, or an analytical approach, versus skeptical empiricism. Which one do we subscribe to for numerical modelling?

### The average versus the dispersion
The average temperature of the grandmother problem. Individual people or things are inherently fragile as the effect of departure from average exposes us to harm. Use transformers as an example: time spent above the rated load causes thermal related degradation and harm, proportional to the amount above the threshold and the duration that this is maintained.
