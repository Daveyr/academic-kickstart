This is the final part to my notes and reflections on the book, _Antifragile_, by Nassim Taleb. [Part one](/post/antifragile-book-notes-part-1/) covered such things as skin in the game, the principle-agent problem, fragility of optimisation and convexity effects, and the power of options over deterministic thinking.

Now we dive into the other topics in the book that I found interesting and/or applicable to my work: _via negativa_, the curse of size, top down versus bottom up approaches, the average versus the dispersion, and the burden of proof of the novel.

## Via negativa
The "do something" fallacy is the mistaken belief that in the face of a problem the act of doing something/anything is always superior to doing nothing. It is closely related to the agency problem, where the agent (e.g., a doctor) must often be seen to be doing something in order to justify their position as an agent, even if premeditated inaction is in the best interest of the priniciple (e.g., the patient). The refrain, "don't just stand there; do something!", is common. The complement, "don't just do things; stop intervening!", much less so.

One of the most prominent illustrations of this in my work is in asset investment planning, where the no-investment case is always the most risky, and any intervention (whether refurbishment or replacement of assets) will reduce the risk. In general this is true, but there are nuances to the approach. What about infant mortality of assets where damage has occurred during installation or where there are manufacturing defects? How is this superior to not replacing an asset that has exceeded its expected life but is otherwise operating just fine? What about finger tip maintenance or stress tests that due to operator error actually cause failure? The observer effect is a phenomenon not readily acknowledged in asset maintenance. It is worth remembering that the Chernobyl nuclear power station meltdown of 1986 was caused during a drill to test the preparedness for the reactor being operated outside of its limits.

_Via negativa_ is the antithesis to the do-something fallacy. The best example that Taleb uses is medicine, where reducing something (like exposure to harmful levels of stress) is superior to the addition of something (like the taking of sleeping pills or anti-anxiety medication). Another book called [Cradle to Cradle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5571.Cradle_to_Cradle) discovered this phenomenon when the authors were asked to make paint more sustainable. Instead of just trying to find like-for-like natural alternatives they also started reducing the list of chemicals in the paint. Once they began simplifying the ingredients list they unpicked a tangle web of dependencies, where many chemicals were only present in order to stabilise the other cocktail of chemicals present in the paint. 

## The curse of size
No government ever bailed out a grocer's stall. Yet Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) accounted for around 52% of UK private sector turnover in 2021 and employed almost 54% of private sector jobs in the UK ([Merchant Savvy](https://www.merchantsavvy.co.uk/uk-sme-data-stats-charts/)). By comparison, the UK finance sector only contributed under 9% to economic output and employed just over 3% of all jobs (public and private) ([Commons Library](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06193/)).

The reader and Taleb intuitively know why banks are bailed out and SMEs are not: they are "too big to fail". Something strange happens with size and risk where failure of a large bank can cause contagion in the wider economy. Taleb uses

Planning fallacy and how banks became "too big to fail". Small projects have small errors that come out in the wash.

### Planner's fallacy

## Top down versus bottom up
Rationalism, or an analytical approach, versus skeptical empiricism. Which one do we subscribe to for numerical modelling?

### The average versus the dispersion
The average temperature of the grandmother problem. Individual people or things are inherently fragile as the effect of departure from average exposes us to harm. Use transformers as an example: time spent above the rated load causes thermal related degradation and harm, proportional to the amount above the threshold and the duration that this is maintained.

## Burden of proof of the novel.

Modern society always seems to be chasing the new thing. Maybe it's a continuation of the do-something fallacy: to change or update is seen to improve. However, in the same way that Taleb cautions against medical intervention unless the stakes are high (like a car crash or cancer), he also cautions against the introduction of the novel and/or unnatural unless the stakes are similarly high. The author uses the example of Thalidomide, first sold over the counter in West Germany in 1975 to treat expecting mothers with morning sickness but was discovered to cause birth defects in the children born to those mothers. Given the benefits were relatively low, the burden of proof for the introduction of a new chemical to the body should have been high. In the present day its use is only for cancer treatment, where its benefit far outweighs its risks.

The same can be said for tobacco. For years the argument ran that the link between smoking and cancer was unproven. A similar argument was also given for the link between industrial emissions and climate change (especially the short time frame of global temperature observation). The burden of proof in both cases was wrong: it was not beholden on the incumbent system (the human body or the planet) to prove unequivocally it was harmed, it was the responsibility of the novel addition to the stable system that it could prove unequivocally that it would do no harm.

## Time filters wisdom

Tobacco, thalydomide.
