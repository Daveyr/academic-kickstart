<p>When I began learning about how to use Docker I stumbled on an excellent project called <a href="https://www.rocker-project.org/">Rocker</a>. For anyone with an x86 machine these Rocker images allow them to run R and most of its dependencies in a containerised environment. Plumber APIs, anyone? What about your own Shiny server? Finally, data scientists using R can have the same level of control on dependencies and package versions as Python users have become accustomed to through <code>venv</code>.</p>
<p>Things are a little more complicated for ARM users, especially 32-bit ARM architectures such as the Raspberry Pi. No Rocker images offer such compatibility so we’re on our own. This was the major reason I’ve started a project, called, <a href="https://www.algorist.co.uk/project/armr/">ARMR</a>, to build a series of Docker images that <strong>do</strong> offer compatibility with the lovable credit card sized computer.</p>
<div id="hello-world" class="section level1">
<h1>Hello world</h1>
<p>Whilst not much has happened with the project so far, at least I have a version of “Hello world”: a container with r-base installed. But first we must install Docker.</p>
<div id="installation" class="section level2">
<h2>Installation</h2>
</div>
<div id="build-a-container" class="section level2">
<h2>Build a container</h2>
<p>Building a container is as simple as writing the code below to a file called <code>Dockerfile</code>. We use an arm32 ubuntu image as a base, from which we set an environment variable to force the terminal to be non-interactive. This is because when r-base is installed it waits for user input when setting parameters, hanging the container build. By setting the installation to be non-interactive we accept all the defaults, including timezone. Be mindful of this when handling datetimes!</p>
<pre><code>FROM arm32v7/ubuntu
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt update &amp;&amp; apt install r-base -y</code></pre>
<p>Once the Dockerfile is created you run it by typing <code>docker build</code> in the same folder in the terminal.</p>
</div>

<div id="whats-next" class="section level1">
<h1>What’s next?</h1>
<p>Future development is likely to encompass the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shiny server (I’d like to host one on this site)</li>
<li>Plumber API server</li>
<li>Rstudio server (so I can do analysis from anywhere on anything, even a tablet)</li>
<li>Images for commonly used packages (Tidyverse, data.table, caret, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
